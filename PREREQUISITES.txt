This branch is about a "query-like" kind of support instead of value.
So, the program should address the following expressions:

expr = X and (Y or Z) and (NOT W)

Algorithm is as follows:

Examine_expr(expr):
    search for last seen left parenthesis: left = expr.split("(")
    search for last seen right parenthesis: right = expr.split(")")
    join the two of them: mini_expr = left + right

    if mini_expr:
        examine_expr(mini_expr)

    analyze_expr(mini_expr)

analyze_expr:
    #TODO here
    analyze for or, and, etc
